# Rule Verifier Open Metadata Engine Service (OMES)

The Rule Verifier OMES is responsible for running
[Open Verification Services](../../frameworks/governance-action-framework/docs/open-verification-service.md)
from the [Governance Action Framework (GAF)](../../frameworks/governance-action-framework).

These services can be called through the Rule Verifier OMES's
REST API or by creating a [Governance Action](../../frameworks/governance-action-framework/docs/governance-action.md)
using the [Governance Engine OMAS](../../access-services/governance-engine).
