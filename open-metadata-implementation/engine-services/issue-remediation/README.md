# Issue Remediation Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)

The Issue Remediation OMES monitors for RemediationRequest instances and runs the requested 
remediation service. Examples of remediation services are duplicate linking and consolidating.
It loads **Open Remediation Engines**,
runs **Open Remediation Services** and  
calls the [Asset Manager OMAS](../../access-services/asset-manager).
