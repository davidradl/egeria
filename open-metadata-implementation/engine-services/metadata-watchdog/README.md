# Metadata Watchdog Open Metadata Engine Services (OMES)

The Metadata Watchdog OMES monitors changes in the metadata and initiates updates as a result.  
One example of a watchdog service is duplicate detection. Another example is to monitor the addition of 
open discovery reports and take action on their content.  
Examples of updates include creating RequestForAction instances.
If loads **Open WatchDog Engines**,
runs **Open WatchDog Services** and
calls the [Asset Manager OMAS](../../access-services/asset-manager).
